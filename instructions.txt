# Flocons de maïs en bain de lait frais de la ferme, servis dans un bol artisanal

## Mise en place

Gather a bowl, a spoon, a box of cornflakes, and a carton of cold milk

## Preparation

Carefully open box of cornflakes, and pour desired quantity into bowl, firmly yet not so as to eventuate undue fragmentation.
*Delicately* shake the bowl to allow the flakes to settle.
With utmost care and precision, position the top end of the milk carton over the bowl in the 3 o'clock position with the spout pointing inward and carefully rotate the carton anticlockwise around its Z axis causing milk to enter the bowl.
The milk should rise to a level clearly visible among the cornflakes, but not concealing them. 
No one can teach you the right level; only experience.
Shortly **BEFORE** the milk reaches the correct level, rotate carton in opposite direction to curtail flow.
Replace milk in refrigerator.

## Serving

Place bowl on table, with spoon approximately two inches to its right. 
On a rectilinear table, place spoon perpendicular to table edge.
On a round table, place spoon parallel to a line between the centre of the bowl and the centre of the table.

Stand back with a dramatic flourish, and await Michelin Star.
